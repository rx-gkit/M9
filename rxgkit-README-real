This is a read me file.
This is a simple GitKit for hacking. A GitKit is a small, simple website that is used to hold other files, kind of like a .ZIP.
This one, made by me, RX, is called M9. For small school related project hacking.
Like Quizlet, Blooket, Prodigy, and other small school games. Email me with: teeyt97@gmail.com ; for more info, or to request a game hack to be added.
